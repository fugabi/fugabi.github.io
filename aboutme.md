**Why CENTO?**

From [Wordsmith](https://wordsmith.org/words/cento.html):

### CENTO 

*PRONUNCIATION*: (SEN-to)

*MEANING*: noun: A literary work, especially a poem, composed of parts taken from works of other authors.

*ETYMOLOGY*: From Latin cento (patchwork). Earliest documented use: 1605

*NOTES*: Nobel-prize-winning poet T.S. Eliot’s observation is relevant to centos: “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion.”

*Examples of centos*:

[The Oxford Cento by David Lehman](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/books/arts/poem-these-fragments-i-have-shored.html)  

[The Dong With the Luminous Nose by John Ashbery](https://nonsenselit.com/2015/12/04/john-ashbery-the-dong-with-the-luminous-nose-1998/)

*USAGE*: “Louis Zukofsky continued to write … a play, a novella, a book of criticism, a 500-page cento of philosophy in homage to Shakespeare …” Bob Perelman; Finding His Voice; Tikkun (Berkeley, California); May/Jun 2007.

Some of little N’s friends can already ride a bike. Little N wanted to learn too. So last week, every day after kindergarten, we went home, took out her bike, made a loop out of a beach towel for her to slide into—so I could hold her steady—and off we went. Every day, for an hour, I ran by her side, helping just enough to keep her balanced. Every day, she kept at it.

At some point on the second day, she asked me to stop. I thought, Okay, that’s it—she's had enough. I helped her come to a stop, she slid out of the towel loop, got off the bike, and started running around with her arms stretched out, drawing circles in the air.

"I am happy!" she screamed. "Soooo happy!"

She drew a few more circles, then got back up and we continued.

Of course, there were so many things that distracted her: a butterfly flapping its tiny wings in front of her, a fluffy dandelion by the side of the road just waiting to be blown, a kid laughing on a swing, people walking past, and more. But she kept at it. And now, a week later, there she is—riding around the block on a new, shiny, slightly bigger bike. She still needs a bit of help now and then, but she’s got it! One week was all it took.

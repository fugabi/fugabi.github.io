What a strange little movie! What a great idea: what if someone's eyes are so dense that it takes light 7 years to pass through them? Just think about it: the light from the sun needs 8 minutes to reach the earth. Why wouldn't it be possible for the light that is bouncing off the world around us and enters our eyes to somehow have to go through a dense, transparent tissue, that slows it down. 7 years, as in this movie, is a lot. But what about several minutes? What would it be like to live in a world that you can only see in retrospect. Would this mean that you end up moving like a sloth? Or that you go carelessly ahead first and deal with what happens next? Would you be cautious? Would you be taking chances?

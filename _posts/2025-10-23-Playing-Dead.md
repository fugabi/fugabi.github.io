_In the game you're the kid and I'm the kid_, she tells me. _And our father is dead._ 

I was surprised. Where did this come from? 

_But that's very sad,_ I tell her. _I don't think I want to do that._ 

_It's just in the game._ 

_I know it is just a game, but even then, it is sad. When somebody is dead, they're gone forever, you know. You can't play with them anymore, you can't talk to them, or laugh with them. They're gone! Forever. You won't see them ever, ever again._ 

She isn't willing to let go. Without even blinking, she says:

_You know, once by kindergarten we saw a dead bird on the ground. It was dead. But we could see it. Everyone could see it. Even if it was dead._

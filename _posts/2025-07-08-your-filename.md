Some of little N's friends can ride a bike already. Little N wanted to learn that too. So last week, every day after kindergarten we went home, took out her bike, made a loop out of a beach towel for her to slide in and for me to hold her stable and off we went. Every day for an hour I was running by her side helping her slightly to keep her balance. Every day she kept at it. 

At some point during the second day she asked me to stop. I thought, OK, that was it! She had enough of this. I helped her stop, she slid out of the towel loop, got off the bike and started running around, arms stretched out, drawing circles in the air. 

*I am happy!* she screamed. *Soooo happy!* 

She drew a few more circles and then she got back up and we continued. 

Of course, there were so many things that distracted her: a butterfly flapping its tiny wings flying in front of her, a fluffy dandelion by the side of the road just waiting to be blown, a kid laughing on a swing, people walking past, etc. But she kept at it. Now, a week later, there she is: riding around the block on a new, shiny, slightly bigger bike. She still needs some help every now and then, but she got it! One week was all it took.

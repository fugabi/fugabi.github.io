A PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH TO WILLIAM LYALL’S *INTELLECT, THE EMOTIONS AND THE MORAL NATURE*

by

GABRIEL FURMUZACHI
April 2001

**Abstract**

In their work **The Faces of Reason: An Essay on Philosophy and Culture in English Canada 1850-1950**, Leslie Armour and Elizabeth Trott consider that the Canadian way of doing philosophy uses reason in an accommodationist manner.

I propose in this work that William Lyall’s **Intellect, the Emotions and the Moral Nature** represents a splendid example of the accommodationist use of reason.

The Maritimes philosopher advances the idea that emotions have a cognitive value, a claim which I support by trying to put Lyall’s ideas in a modern framework offered by French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre.

Latent in Lyall’s work can also be found a theory of metaphor which I try to revive with the help of French philosopher Paul Ricoeur.

Thus, following Lyall, emotions and reason are always in a balance and they work together in order to give us a more consistent and fuller grasp of reality.
